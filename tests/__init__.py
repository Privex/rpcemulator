"""
This module contains test cases for Privex's JsonRPC Emulators (rpcemulator).

Testing pre-requisites
----------------------

    - Ensure you have any mandatory requirements installed (see setup.py's install_requires)
    - You may wish to install any optional requirements listed in README.md for best results
    - Python 3.7 is recommended at the time of writing this. See README.md in-case this has changed.

Running via PyTest
------------------

To run the tests, we strongly recommend using the ``pytest`` tool (used by default for our Travis CI)::

    # Install requirements.txt which should include PyTest
    user@host: ~/rpcemulator $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    # You can add `-v` for more detailed output, just like when running the tests directly.
    user@host: ~/rpcemulator $ pytest

    ===================================== test session starts =====================================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.7.0, pytest-5.0.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.12.0

    tests/test_bitcoin.py ....                                                               [100%]


    ============================ 4 passed, 1 warnings in 0.17 seconds =============================

Running directly using Python Unittest
--------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can run the tests by hand with ``python3.7`` ( or just ``python3`` ) ::

    user@the-matrix ~/rpcemulator $ python3.7 -m tests
    ....
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 4 tests in 0.001s

    OK

For more verbosity, simply add ``-v`` to the end of the command::

    user@the-matrix ~/rpcemulator $ python3 -m tests -v
    test_getblockchaininfo (tests.test_bitcoin.TestBitcoinEmulator)
    Test that the ``getblockchaininfo`` JsonRPC call returns data as expected ... ok
    test_getnetworkinfo (tests.test_bitcoin.TestBitcoinEmulator)
    Test that the ``getnetworkinfo`` JsonRPC call returns data as expected ... ok
    test_getnewaddress (tests.test_bitcoin.TestBitcoinEmulator)
    Get a new address from the emulator and confirm it seems like a BTC address ... ok
    test_send_valid (tests.test_bitcoin.TestBitcoinEmulator)
    Test sending coins to external address creates a TX in listtransactions, and reduces the balance ... ok
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 4 tests in 0.242s
    
    OK
